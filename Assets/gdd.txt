	Here outlining all the coding parts

Controls:
-wasd motion, pathfinding, click to move towards cursor naively?	
-click to cast spell in cursor direction

Physics:
-Knockback for player and enemies 
-Upward knockback for monsters?

Spellcasting:
-Spell AoE indicators with cast on release / second click?
-Casting a spell rotates to next spell, to guarantee that all varieties will be seen 
-Starting to cast a spell puts the player into conjuring mode where they build up the spell (and can't move?)

Spells:
-Crystal spikes: sprouts advancing crystalline spikes from the ground which shatter
-Volatile blob: creates a wobbly blob and tosses it forward, exploding into plasma arcs, flames and steam
-Cursed swarm: Swarm of demon bats blazing with cursed fire that dive into enemies
-Celestial lance: Tiny, fast, beaming projectile dives from the sky creating a shockwave

Enemies:
-Enemies randomly spawn for target practice, mostly passive AI
-Passive as in wander randomly and move towards player based on "aggression" which increases 
-Sewer slimes and flaming skeletons seem appropriate?
-Slimes move in bounces, skeletons walk steadily towards chosen point
